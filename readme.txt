Professional Portfolio Overview

Create a portfolio site highlighting your work that can be shared with potential employers. Focus first on building a good structure, then later style and lay out with with CSS.

Tasks
[X] First, set up your username.github.io site as per the instructions at https://pages.github.com.

Build the document structure
[X] Create a main page (index.html) representing a professional portfolio, including the following:

[X] an appropriate <header> element
[X] a <nav> element linking to each of the sections
[X] an <h1> element with your page title (there can be only one)
[] a <section> element for each of the following, each of which should contain an appropriate heading element:
	[] About Me, consisting of:
		[] brief biographical information
		[] photo
		[] contact information
		[] links to your professional networking site profiles, including at least GitHub and LinkedIn
		[] list of skills
		[] Include whatever other information you consider pertinent.
	[] Projects, consisting of at least three, each represented as an <article>
		[] name of project, linked to GitHub repository or the repository/project’s GitHub Pages screenshot
		[] skills / technologies used
		[] an appropriate <footer> element

Lay out and style your portfolio
[] Assign ids/classes to sections/etc, then use css grid to lay out your page. Reference MDN and this tutorial to work out how to use grid: http://cssgridgarden.com/
[] To contain the elements of your grid, you will want to create a <div>, something like <div id="container">...</div>.
[] Create CSS rules to style page elements appropriately.

Using online resources
Any resources (images, etc) you use should be:
[] free for non-commercial use
[] copied to your repository and referenced there rather than via a uri pointing to another site
